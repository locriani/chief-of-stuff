# chief-of-stuff architecture

This is the canonical architecture document. The README is the user's guide and is not this document. Every section is numbered, numbers are never reused, and a review grades the code against these sections.

## 1. Style

The project follows Clean Architecture as Robert C. Martin defines it, and SOLID. The circles, from the centre outward, are Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, and Frameworks and Drivers. The dependency rule: source code dependencies point inward only, so nothing in an inner circle names anything in an outer one. Single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion are the five principles a review holds each module to.

YAGNI and DRY limit both. An interface, factory or layer that no caller and no section of this document needs today is not added, and a copy of what already exists is not made. Where a section here and the code disagree, the section stands and the code is recorded as a gap in `compliance.md`.

## 2. Skills

A skill is loaded on demand on every host. The agent rules name the skill and the moment to read it, and the host reads the skill's file then. No host receives the text of a skill in its starting prompt.

## 3. Page modules

The shared helpers the page modules use (the stylesheet head, the file write that skips unchanged content, the day's context, the pending count, the duration span, and the markdown and section renderers) live in one module of their own and are public names. `decision_page.py`, `issue_page.py`, `source_page.py` and `render_board.py` import them from there. No page module imports another page module's underscore-prefixed name.

## 4. Circles

Each script under `scripts/`, the two launchers and the hook belong to one circle. A module that does the work of two circles is a gap against this section until it is split.

| Circle | Modules |
|---|---|
| Entities | `tracker.py`, `md.py`, `clock.py`, `runtimes.py`, `findings.py`, `ownership.py`, `orphans.py`, `estimate.py` |
| Use Cases | `audit_tasks.py`, `dispatch_prompt.py`, `one_shot.py`, `kanban.py`, `merge_ready.py`, `merge_approved.py`, `review_threads.py`, `task_forge.py` |
| Interface Adapters, presenters | `fragment.py`, `columns.py`, `panels.py`, `gantt.py`, `flow_chart.py`, `render_board.py`, `decision_page.py`, `issue_page.py`, `source_page.py`, `module_graph.py`, and the page module of section 3 |
| Interface Adapters, gateways | `backlog.py`, `backlog_ref.py`, `board_sources.py`, `workspace.py`, `settings.py`, `tracker_read.py`, `tracker_write.py` |
| Frameworks and Drivers | `git_trees.py`, `git_view.py`, `inbox.py`, `notify.py`, `notify_service.py`, `process_status.py`, `session_exec.py`, `spawn_session.py`, `probe_health.py`, `pages.py`, `chief_of_stuff.py`, `start_coordinator.py`, `hooks/hooks.json` |

## 5. Enforcement

The dependency rule of section 1 is enforced by `evals/test_architecture.py`. It holds the circle table of section 4 and fails on any import from an inner circle to an outer one. Imports that violate the rule today are listed in that test by name, the list may only shrink, and each entry is also a gap in `compliance.md`. A new script is placed in a circle in the same change that adds it.
