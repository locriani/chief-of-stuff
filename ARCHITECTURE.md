# chief-of-stuff architecture

This is the canonical architecture document. The README is the user's guide and is not this document. Every section is numbered, numbers are never reused, and a review grades the code against these sections.

## 1. Style

The project follows Clean Architecture and SOLID. Source code dependencies point inward only: a module never imports from a layer outside its own that is further from the rules. Single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion are the five principles a review holds each module to.

YAGNI and DRY limit both. An interface, factory or layer that no caller and no section of this document needs today is not added, and a copy of what already exists is not made. Where a section here and the code disagree, the section stands and the code is recorded as a gap in `compliance.md`.

## 2. Skills

A skill is loaded on demand on every host. The agent rules name the skill and the moment to read it, and the host reads the skill's file then. No host receives the text of a skill in its starting prompt.

## 3. Page modules

The shared helpers the page modules use (the stylesheet head, the file write that skips unchanged content, the day's context, the pending count, the duration span, and the markdown and section renderers) live in one module of their own and are public names. `decision_page.py`, `issue_page.py`, `source_page.py` and `render_board.py` import them from there. No page module imports another page module's underscore-prefixed name.
