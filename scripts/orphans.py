"""Whose is a tree at risk, and are they still here (#43). Pure: the join, and nothing that asks.

Each claim source (File ownership rows, the worker registry, one-shot launchers) decides its own
claim's liveness, because only it knows how. Any live claim holds the tree: a false orphan sends the
user after a session that is working. A tree no source claims is `Unclaimed` — owner unknown is a
different fact from owner gone, and the tree may be the user's own.
