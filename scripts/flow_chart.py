"""The board's Flow charts: each task's stage history, read from the tracker's `stage:` Log lines, drawn by gantt.py.

`chief-of-stuff log --stage` writes `- HH:MM stage: <name> → <stage>`. A segment runs from each move to the
next and the last to now; a lane's last stage ends the row. A held task is hatched from now through the
window, and an open task with an estimated end draws its remaining stages ahead as forecast. An open task at
its lane's first stage with no move yet is queued: forecast only, after the running forecasts, in worker slots.
Rows that share a tracker issue (a review loop's build/Review/Fix/Verify passes) merge into one row.
Until a task's first `stage:` move, it moves on the one-shot launcher's lines: started → implement, completed → pr,
HUMAN REVIEW NEEDED → review. A done task's last segment ends at its done time, not now.
