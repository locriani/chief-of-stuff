"""Propose a disposition for every row in a tracker's `## Issues`, then create only what the user approves.

The triage is the expensive half; the moving is one API call per issue. Existing rows may be stale,
so this script proposes a reasoned disposition and waits for a human to edit the report before apply.

    python3 migrate_backlog.py --tracker <tracker.md> --report backlog-migration.md
    # …the user edits the disposition column…
    python3 migrate_backlog.py --tracker <tracker.md> --apply backlog-migration.md --config CLAUDE.md --commit

Each row is keyed by a hash of its own text. That makes the report and the apply step agree about
*which row* even as the tracker moves underneath them, and it makes a row that changed after the
report **unmigratable rather than silently migrated as something else** — no disposition is not
consent.

The table is read through `render_board`'s splitter, which is mark-aware: a `|` inside a code span
is a pipe, not a cell edge (finding 100). A second splitter here would reintroduce that bug.
