"""List the open pull or merge requests ready to merge, and merge one that is.

    chief-of-stuff merge-approved --root R [--repo owner/name]            list, ready ones first
    chief-of-stuff merge-approved --root R [--repo owner/name] --merge N  merge N, or say what blocks it

With `[workflow] merge_owner = "approval"` (the user, 2026-09-26 01:57, #97: "I want to be able to mark a PR
as approved, and you handle merging in what I mark approved."): `approver` is the user's forge username, and
no other account's approval counts. Ready is all three: the approver's approval on the head commit, a
pipeline that passed (or none), and no conflict. The merge names the head it checked, so a push after the
check fails the merge instead of landing unreviewed code.

With `merge_owner = "worker"` (#420): the owning worker merges a request once its reviewer cleared it and its
head pipeline is green, so this command only lists. Each open request prints its merge-ready line (head sha,
pipeline id, status and sha, conflicts, unresolved threads), ready ones first, then one line naming the ready
ones for their owning worker. It never merges and refuses `--merge`. Here a request with no pipeline is not ready: a
green pipeline on the head sha is what a worker merges on. With `user` merging stays the user's.
