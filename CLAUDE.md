# Project: chief-of-stuff

A versioned coordinator for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor CLI, and Antigravity CLI. The Claude plugin ships `agents/chief-of-stuff.md`; `start_coordinator.py` adapts the same rules for the other hosts.

## Rules

- **TDD.** Behaviour starts as a failing eval case. The agent file changes only to turn a red case green.
- **Evals are runtime selectable.** `python3 evals/run.py --runtime claude|codex|cursor|agy --arm baseline|agent --model <host-model> [--case <glob>] [--runs N] [--golden]`. Claude is the default runtime and defaults to Sonnet for iteration; other runtimes require an explicit model. Run the Python suite with `python3 -m unittest discover -s evals -p 'test_*.py'`. The harness uses temporary fixtures and mocks external integrations; it records denied calls as attempts.
- **Claude plugin model policy.** The Claude agent frontmatter pins `model: opus`; Claude golden cases use `--golden --model opus --runs 3`. This policy applies to Claude runs only. Codex, Cursor, and Antigravity use their selected model for the same case definitions. A case is golden when its `case.json` says `"golden": true` with a `golden_why`; an empty golden selection exits nonzero.
- **No shell scripts.** Harness code, shims, mocks, and probes are Python (or another real language). Shell appears only as a one-line command someone types.
- **Fixtures are templates.** `{{today}}`, `{{yesterday}}`, `{{tomorrow}}`, `{{tz}}`, `{{now_hhmm}}`, `{{now±Nh}}` (`|local`, `|hhmm`), `{{dotgit}}` (a `.git` dir name, since git cannot track one), and `{{live_pid}}` (a pid alive for the whole run) in file names and contents. No hardcoded dates. An unknown token fails the run.
- **Fixtures are generic.** No data from any workspace that uses this agent — no patient data, no program documents, no real deploy names.

## Architecture

Read by `claude --agent frank-lloyd-aight`. Every path, name, and tool the architecture session uses comes from this block.

- User: Zach, he/him
- Project: chief-of-stuff
- Architecture directory: `architecture/`
- Canonical document: `architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Kept canonical by this session, never moved, never renumbered.
- Plan directory: `~/.claude/plans/`
- Review directory: `architecture/`; pages are named `<subject>-review.html`
- Publisher: self-hosted; URL http://127.0.0.1:8787/; dir `/Users/locriani/Developer/Gauntlet/Areas/pages/`. A review page written there is at `http://127.0.0.1:8787/<subject>-review.html`.
- Session tools: `ListAgents` to find sessions, `SendMessage` to reach one
- Diagram renderer: `~/Developer/ai-additions/plugins/mermaid-system-design/skills/mermaid-system-design/scripts/mermaid-check.py` (exit 0 rendered, 1 a diagram failed, 2 renderer missing). A diagram that did not render is never approved.
- Commits: this session commits its own work in its own worktree, in small meaningful commits, and pushes each one. It does not merge.
