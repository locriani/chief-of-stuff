"""Unit tests for scripts/migrate_backlog.py: the triage is the expensive half, not the moving.

The tracker's `## Issues` rows are six hours stale by the time they are read — several closed
themselves and at least two were wrong about their own state when the coordinator audited at 04:00.
So nothing here decides. It proposes, Zach corrects, and only what he approves is created.

The row's own key is a hash of its text, which makes the report and the migration agree about
*which row* even after the tracker moves — and makes a row that changed since the report
unmigratable rather than silently migrated as something else.
