"""Unit tests for scripts/findings.py: the audit and its watcher read one list of finding words.

`audit_tasks` starts each finding line with one of these words, and `start_coordinator`'s watcher forwards the
lines that start with a watched one. A finding the audit gains without a word here, or a word the watcher drops,
fails here instead of going unforwarded without anyone noticing.
