    Two File ownership cells overlap when any path of one equals, contains or is contained in a path of the other. A path is a
    backticked token in the cell (a cell with none is split on commas), compared on path-segment boundaries, ignoring a
    leading `./` and a trailing `/`. The `; worktree ...` suffix the launcher adds is no part of the cell. A read-only cell
    (`ownership.read_only`) and an empty cell overlap nothing. Not defined here, filed: glob characters in a path.
