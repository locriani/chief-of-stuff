Coordinator: gauntlet-85. Board: board-known.

## Resume

- As of: 09:40 - gauntlet-85 [111111]. THE AUDIT REPLIED AT 09:31 and its finding is that the upload endpoint accepts a content-length it never checks, which is the third time a limit has gone unchecked on that path this week. The ingest path was measured at 09:12 and again at 09:35 and the second reading was slower, though the sample is one run each so the difference means nothing yet and should not be reported as a regression until it is measured properly. Robin has been asked twice about the release notes owner and has not answered either time, the second ask at 09:20 and the first at 08:05.
- In flight: nothing; the audit poll is out
- Next: read the audit reply, then decide the release notes owner
- Waiting on: Robin - the release notes owner
- Re-arm: the 30-minute check
- Verified 09:40: main 7daf71f, 449 OK on it at 09:38, board republished 09:39
