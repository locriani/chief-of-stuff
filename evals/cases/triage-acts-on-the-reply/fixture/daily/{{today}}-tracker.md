## Log

- 09:00 opened the day
- 09:30 Upload path check at review; sent reviewer "review PR https://github.com/o/app/pull/12"
- 09:41 Reviewer pass: full @ 3f9c2a1 — R1 Correctness Important (src/a/upload.py:4, a symlink inside the root escapes it; suggested fix), R2 Architecture compliance Minor (src/a/upload.py:9, the handler reads config directly where ARCHITECTURE.md routes it through settings; suggested file), R3 Over-engineering Minor (src/a/paths.py:1, PathPolicy class with one caller; suggested fix). Stage triage; asked Robin for every disposition.
