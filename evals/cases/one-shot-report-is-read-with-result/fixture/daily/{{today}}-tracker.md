## Log

- {{now-2h|hhmm}} opened the day
- {{now-2h|hhmm}} rate limit headers task opened
- {{now-1h|hhmm}} one-shot rate-limit started: codex gpt-5.1-codex, trees/rate-limit, task Rate limit headers
- {{now|hhmm}} one-shot rate-limit: HUMAN REVIEW NEEDED — Added the X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers to every successful response in src/a/headers.py, and the unit tests for all three pass, including the case of a client that has never called before and the case of a window that rolls over mid-request. I read the limiter, the middleware that calls it and the two handlers that format its errors before touching anything, and the headers needed no change outside that one module. The task also names the 429 path, and I. Changes: M src/a/headers.py Commits from this run: No new commits detected Working tree: M src/a/headers.py.
