"""A lint over every eval case: the fixture shapes that rewarded the coordinator for doing less.

Four shapes in one day (findings 65, 68, 74): a repo with no files, a fixture with no `CLAUDE.md`, a
Sessions table the ruleset had stopped writing, a `- Verified:` line with no clock. Every one passed
every unit test, because no test read the cases. This one does, and it runs under CIMP on main.

        Before proposing a new task for dispatch, validate its Tasks and File ownership rows with
        `chief-of-stuff worker --check --root . --task <name>`, which needs no `--cwd`, makes no worktree and starts
        nothing; add `--name <session>` when the task is a standing row and `--one-shot` for a one-shot task; when it
        prints `refused: <why>`, tell the user that refusal and do not propose the task.

        --check shares the real dispatch's compose, so `--name` and `--one-shot` change what it accepts; `--cwd` is
        never needed. A standing row's own session name is what lets it skip the issue rule, so the grader that bars
        `--cwd` no longer bars `--name`: the fixture's Retry budget row is not a standing row, and the rule asks for a
