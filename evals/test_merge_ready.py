"""`chief-of-stuff merge-ready` prints one verdict per open request, from the head pipeline, never the forge's merge status (#419).

The coordinator wrote "mergeable" from the forge's detailed merge status, which says only that there are no conflicts, so a red
pipeline and a request with open findings were both called mergeable. The command reads the head pipeline (id, status, the sha it
ran on), conflicts and unresolved review threads, and prints one verdict: ready | red | running | conflicts | findings open |
stale pipeline | no pipeline. It never merges and needs no approver or merge_owner setting.
