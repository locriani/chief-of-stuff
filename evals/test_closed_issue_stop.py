"""A closed issue ends its Flow row, board and task page alike (#220).

Today only a merged change ends a waiting/running task's row (render_board.merged_map,
flow_chart.build(merged=...)). A tracker task whose forge issue was closed without a merge keeps its row
(and the task page's elapsed/waiting totals) running to now, even once "What happens next" already says
the issue is closed. A grouped row (two tasks sharing one issue, merged into a single Flow row) has a
second, related bug: when the row that "moved last" is finished, its group-mates' own segments can still
run past that finish time. These tests pin down:

    1. board_sources.Issue gains `closed_at`; GH_ISSUE/GL_ISSUE ask for `closedAt`; both parsers fill it;
       the cache round-trips it, and an older cache with no `closed_at` key still loads (as None).
    2. render_board.merged_map is replaced by forge_ends(tasks, sources, zone) -> dict[str, tuple[datetime,
       str]]: a task's name to (time, "merged") for its latest merged change, or (time, "closed") for its
       closed issue's close time when there is no merged change. A merge wins.
    3. flow_chart.build's `merged=` keyword becomes `ended: dict[str, tuple[datetime, str]] | None`. A task
       in it has its segments clipped at the time, and its row's status is the word, its note `<word> HH:MM`.
    4. When rows sharing an issue merge into one (flow_chart._merge_issues) and the row that moved last is
       finished (merged, closed or done), every segment in the group ends no later than that row's own last
       segment end — not just the winning row's.
    5. issue_page.render's elapsed end and its worker-span stop both come from those same clipped rows, so
       "Worked X of Y elapsed" reports Y from the last segment end, not from now.
