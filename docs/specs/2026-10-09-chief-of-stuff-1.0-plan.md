# chief-of-stuff 1.0: implementation plan

Plan for [`2026-10-09-chief-of-stuff-1.0-design.md`](2026-10-09-chief-of-stuff-1.0-design.md), which Zach approved on 2026-10-09. Decision numbers (D1, D5a, …) refer to that document's Decisions section. Nothing here is built yet.

## Ground rules

From the repo's `CLAUDE.md` and the design's Constraints. They bind every milestone.

- **TDD.** Behaviour starts as a failing eval or unit case; code changes only to turn it green.
- **No shell scripts.** Everything is Python.
- **Fixtures are templates and generic.** No workspace data.
- **Clean Architecture is the target** (D: architecture answer): every new module sits in a circle, `evals/test_architecture.py` enforces it, and rows C1-C8 in `architecture/compliance.md` are closed as part of 1.0.
- **Every model call goes through one model adapter.** The trio gate, the review verdicts, the backing coordinator session, and anything else that talks to Claude via `claude -p --output-format json` use a single model port with a `claude -p` adapter behind it. No module outside that adapter spawns `claude` or parses its JSON. The same rule is how a second host stays an adapter later (design D7).
- **Examine before importing.** Old specs, golden evals, code and tests are references. Each item brought across gets an entry in a carry/drop ledger (M0) with a reason.
- **No new dependency without Zach's yes.** Name it, say where it comes from and why, wait. The ORM and store are the first such request.
- **Every change lands through a PR on a branch and bumps the plugin version.** `main` is protected.

## Milestones

Each milestone ends with exit criteria that are runnable checks. The four success signs from the design are the acceptance test for 1.0: **S1** zero routine nudges, **S2** one gantt line per issue, **S3** merges land unprompted, **S4** survives a restart with no catch-up prompting.

### M0. Approvals, spikes, and the carry/drop ledger

No product code. Produces decisions.

1. **Store and ORM proposal for Zach's approval.** Present candidates with source and reason (a Python ORM over SQLite is the likely shape; candidates and trade-offs to be researched, none adopted). Block M1 on his yes.
2. **`claude -p --output-format json` spike.** This also fixes the shape of the model port the adapter implements (request, structured response, session handle, error/quota result). Prove: structured judgement calls (a review verdict, a trio vote), session continuity across calls, behaviour at quota or outage, cost accounting. Output: a short note and a throwaway script in `_scratch`, not shipped.
3. **Carry/drop ledger.** One row per current behaviour or module (tick, kanban, notify, PARA filing, launchers, `claude_profile`, mailbox, decision pages, the 110 eval cases), each marked carry, rewrite, or drop, with the reason. Zach reviews the ledger once.
4. **Behaviour spec extraction.** From the golden evals and the architecture doc, list the behaviours 1.0 must reproduce. Resolve the design's remaining Open items that block M1-M3: policy content for code review, trio selection rule, default limits.

Exit: store approved, spike note, ledger approved, open items resolved or deferred explicitly.

**M0 status (2026-10-10):**
- Store and ORM: **approved** by Zach: SQLAlchemy pinned to the 2.0.x line (2.0.54) with Alembic 1.20.0 on SQLite via stdlib `sqlite3` (adds `mako`, `markupsafe`, `typing-extensions`). Nothing is installed until M1 starts. Runner-up was Peewee.
- Spike: done; see [`2026-10-09-chief-of-stuff-1.0-spike-claude-p.md`](2026-10-09-chief-of-stuff-1.0-spike-claude-p.md). Quota and outage behaviour is unverified and must be treated as retryable-unknown.
- Ledger: drafted, awaiting Zach's one review; see [`2026-10-09-chief-of-stuff-1.0-ledger.md`](2026-10-09-chief-of-stuff-1.0-ledger.md).
- Still open: code-review policy content, trio selection rule, default limits, whether workers run through the model adapter.

### M1. Core model and store

1. Schema for work items keyed by forge issue, stage segments keyed (issue, stage, attempt), decisions, file ownership, log, resume state. Unique constraint on the issue key.
2. Repository layer behind the ORM, upsert-only writes.
3. Tests first: writing a second row for an existing issue updates it, never inserts; concurrent writers cannot create a duplicate; resume state round-trips.

Exit (S2 at the data layer): a test that tries to create a duplicate gantt row for one issue and cannot.

### M2. Forge adapter and the issue-first gate

1. GitHub and GitLab adapter: read issues and MRs/PRs, create an issue, read CI and review state.
2. Issue-first gate: starting work with no issue creates it first. A workspace with no `Backlog:` line is refused, and the setup helper walks Zach through configuring one (D3, Decided).
3. Forge calls prefer `gh` subcommands over `gh api` where they cover the call.

Exit: eval cases for work-without-issue (issue created, then one row) and no-backlog (refused, setup offered).

### M3. The engine loop

1. State-driven reconcile (replaces mailbox-driven ticks): each pass computes what the state calls for. Free worker slots with dispatchable work → dispatch. Approved, policy-satisfied work → merge. Missing review → launch it. Reviews run in parallel.
2. Model adapter: the `claude -p --output-format json` implementation of the model port, with fakes for tests so engine evals never call a real model. Workers launched in git worktrees. Decide in M0 whether workers also run through the adapter.
3. Supervisor: runs as a long-lived process (launchd or equivalent), restarts itself, and resumes after quota reset or outage by waiting, not by asking.
4. Cleanup: worktree and resource hygiene is a carried behaviour (stale worktrees once used 185 GB).

Exit (S1, S4): an eval that kills the engine mid-run and a fake quota hit, and the run resumes with no prompt and no state loss.

### M4. Review and merge policy

1. Declarative policy file: reviewer roles and models, what counts as an open finding, retry limits, when the architect is consulted. Content settled in M0.
2. Engine enforces the gates (burn down to no open findings, architect consult) and merges when the policy is satisfied. Merging under policy is not an interrupt; this overturns the `merge_owner = "user"` default (D6).
3. **Revisit the Triage rule in this phase** (Zach, 2026-10-09: "make a note to visit this during this phase"; no direction chosen yet). Today it asks about any non-trivial or security finding (`skills/review-pipeline/SKILL.md`, Triage), which conflicts with consulting Zach only on exceptions. Options raised: route every would-be ask through the trio gate; the same except security and Critical findings, which always go to Zach; or widen the automatic-fix rule and trio the rest. Decide with Zach during M4, before the rule is carried.

Exit (S3): an eval where work meeting the policy merges with no human input, and one where a policy gate fails and it does not.

### M5. Decision gate and interrupts

Zach, 2026-10-09: "we'll revisit at m5 time." This scope is provisional; reopen it before starting M5.

1. Trio gate (D5a): before any ask, consult a topic-appropriate trio through the model adapter (three calls, structured verdicts). Unanimous → adopt their recommendation and record it. Any concern → escalate to Zach.
2. Trio selection rule and verdict record (settled in M0).
3. Interrupt set: real goal ambiguity after the trio, unrecoverable failure after retries, budget or quota about to exceed a limit.
4. Engine config holds spend, quota and time limits, with workspace override.

Exit (S1): evals showing a routine question resolved by a unanimous trio with no ping, a split trio escalating, and a limit breach pinging.

### M6. Board and pings

Zach, 2026-10-09: revisit at M6 time. This scope is provisional; reopen it before starting M6.

1. Board reads from the store. Gantt shows one line per issue with segments by (issue, stage, attempt). Adjust the existing UI only where the model needs it (D8).
2. Decisions that pass the gate are board items, answered on the board. No separate decision pages.
3. Notify sends exception pings only, linking to the board item.

Exit (S2): a board render test over a day with rework on one issue shows exactly one line with several segments.

### M7. Cutover and 1.0.0

1. Run the new engine beside the old harness on one workspace; compare against the old behaviour using the golden cases.
2. Fix gaps found; retire the old harness paths that are not carried.
3. Cut `1.0.0` (plugin.json and marketplace.json).
4. Bake: a week of real use judged against S1-S4.

Exit: S1-S4 hold for a week of real use.

## Risks

- **The model surface is a CLI, not a server.** `claude -p` per call means session continuity and cost accounting are the engine's job. The M0 spike exists to find the limits early.
- **Evals are large.** The old suite is ~49k lines. Porting by hand is slow; the ledger makes the carried set explicit so it stays small.
- **Policy content is the unsettled core of M4 and M5.** If M0 does not settle it, those milestones stall; budget a decision session with Zach inside M0.
- **Overturning `merge_owner = "user"`** removes a human gate. Mitigation: the policy must be demonstrably satisfied and logged, and the limit and exception paths keep a human in the loop for anything exceptional.

## Order and parallelism

M0 first and alone. M1 → M2 → M3 in sequence (each depends on the previous layer). M4 and M5 can overlap once M3's loop exists. M6 can start after M1 against fixtures. M7 last.

## Open items carried into the plan

Resolved in M0: policy content, trio selection rule, default limits, the carry/drop ledger, and whether workers run via `claude -p`. Resolved in M3: supervision and session-state handling across `claude -p` calls.
