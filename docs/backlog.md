# Backlog setup

The workspace `CLAUDE.md` `## Coordinator` block may name one issue backlog. The tracker keeps active tasks and their issue references; the backlog keeps work that has not been assigned. With no `Backlog:` line, issue checks are off.

## GitHub

```md
- Backlog: GitHub issues; repo owner/repository
```

Use `owner/repository` or a GitHub repository URL. The `gh` CLI supplies authentication. `scripts/backlog.py` lists, creates, comments on, and closes issues. Writes preview by default and require `--commit`:

```sh
python3 scripts/backlog.py --config /path/to/workspace/CLAUDE.md --create "Task title" --body "Outcome, reason, and acceptance criteria" --commit
python3 scripts/backlog.py --config /path/to/workspace/CLAUDE.md --close 42 --commit
```

For a new GitHub issue, `--parent 12` and repeated `--blocked-by 7` flags create native relationships. The body is passed to `gh` on stdin. A workspace may impose its own issue template and content rules.

## GitLab

```md
- Backlog: GitLab; host https://gitlab.example.com; project group/repository; token env CHIEF_OF_STUFF_GITLAB_TOKEN
```

`host` and `project` select the API endpoint. The token value comes from the named environment variable, a macOS Keychain entry for the host, or `glab` login; the configuration contains only the variable name. The client reads, creates, comments on, and closes issues. Labels requested with `--labels` are created when needed. Writes also preview until `--commit`.

## Checks and failures

`python3 scripts/backlog.py --config /path/to/workspace/CLAUDE.md` prints open and closed counts. `--list` prints open issues; `--state closed --list` prints closed issues. A missing CLI, credential, unreachable host, malformed response, or partial result reports an unknown backlog and exits nonzero. An unknown result never counts as an empty backlog.

The previous workspace specific setup and migration history are preserved in [backlog-history.md](archive/backlog-history.md).
