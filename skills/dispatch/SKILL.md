name: dispatch
description: Use before choosing a worker or model, proposing or launching a dispatch, acting on a yes to a proposal, writing the Tasks and File ownership rows, showing an assignment block, relaunching a task, or reading a finished one-shot's report.
---

### Rows

You do not do the work: writing documents, editing source, auditing or checking code or config, research. A look at a file to judge it is work; a look to find its path or its owner is routing. Work goes to a new context or a working session. When the user asks for it, or when a checklist item needs it, file its issue where the block names a `Backlog:`, unless it is a workflow step, which takes the token `workflow` (see Tracker), write the Tasks row (state `open`, owner `unassigned`, the issue in `issue`), the File ownership row for it, and a Log line. For one-shot, launch when ready without another question. For a new interactive session, show a **dispatch proposal** and await approval.

Those two rows are the dispatch. The Tasks item is the whole ask — write it so a session that reads only that row knows what it is for and what finished looks like, because that is the text the session receives. The File ownership row names the paths it may edit, keyed on the task, and it is written **before** launch or proposal so the worker receives a defined scope. A task name alone is enough for a session to find its way and not enough for it to act, and a session given too little invents plausible work or stops — the second is what this asks for, and only the first is a silent failure.

### Worker and model

The dispatch record, or interactive proposal, carries:

Name the runtime (`claude`, `agy`, `codex`, or `cursor`), exact model, worktree and task in the dispatch Log or interactive proposal. A model class alone does not determine the runtime.

Before choosing a worker, read `chief-of-stuff-models.md` in the workspace root when it exists. It is the workspace's editable provider and model routing guidance, copied there by the initializer. It chooses models; Dispatch authority governs launch approval even if an older copy says every launch needs a yes. Follow an explicit user choice first, then this guidance; verify an exact model ID and runtime through the configured interactive login shell before naming them. Do not silently substitute another model or provider. Read `[workers] mode` in the Settings TOML and record the execution mode. Routine one-shot dispatch is authorized by the setting or the user's task-specific request. That request is the approval, so do not ask again; the launch follows the interactive launch steps and registers its session. In an interactive workspace, a user's request for one-shot applies to that task only.

When the Settings TOML has `[models]`, it chooses the model: run `chief-of-stuff models --root . --class <class>` for the task's class and launch the entry it prints, effort included, or pass `--class <class>` to the worker call. Each `[models.<class>]` table holds a `rotation` of `runtime:model-id@effort` entries: the first is the suggested model, the rest the fallback order, and `@effort` is optional. Class names are the workspace's own, such as `deep`, `implement`, `fast` and `review`. Launch an entry as `--runtime <runtime> --model <model-id>`, plus `--effort <effort>` when the entry has one, with the model ID verbatim. An explicit user choice still wins. When the chosen model is unavailable or out of quota, advance the rotation with `chief-of-stuff models --root . --class <class> --after <entry>` and launch that entry instead. The dispatch Log records the entry used and why. Review of a change takes `--not-family <the implementer's runtime>`, so the reviewer comes from another family. Without `[models]`, `chief-of-stuff-models.md` applies as before.

### Assignment

- The channel. In an interactive workspace with no `Agent:` lines in the block: a background subagent (the `Agent` tool with `run_in_background: true`), and the subagent type. In a one-shot workspace with no `Agent:` lines, use a one-shot CLI worker in its own worktree and omit `--type` from the worker call. With `Agent:` lines: a session of one type named there — its own terminal, its own worktree — and then the proposal also names the branch and the path you would create, and the session's name. The name is the one the user gave, or `<role>-<runtime>-<NN>`: the role is what it does (`implementer`, `reviewer`, `researcher`), runtime is `claude`, `agy`, `codex`, or `cursor`, and `NN` is the lowest available two-digit number for that role and runtime. Never infer the runtime or model from a name. Never reuse a live session name; a stopped name may be reused. Record the runtime and model explicitly; an interactive approval covers those choices. An agent type is not a subagent type: the first is a session started with `claude --agent`, the second is the `Agent` tool's own.
- The assignment, in one fenced block, in exactly this shape (labeled lines, each on one line, never hard-wrapped):

  ```
  Task: <the Tasks item, in full>
  Requirement: <the task's checklist cell; leave the line out when it is blank>
  Issue: <the issue's URL; only where the block names a backlog>
  Tracker: <tracker path from the Coordinator block, e.g. daily/2026-09-16-tracker.md>
  Owns: <the File ownership paths for this task; "none" if it only reads or replies>. Do not touch any other file.
  Report: <what to reply with when done>
  ```

  For a session, you are not writing this block, you are **showing** it: the script reads those lines back off the two rows you already wrote, resolves the tracker to an absolute path, names the worktree, and adds a header of its own that you cannot write or withhold. If what you show differs from the rows, the session receives the rows. So the way to change the assignment is to fix the row and show it again, never to reword the block.

  One dispatch is one task. A prompt that names a second Tasks item is two dispatches; split it. A `task` type reports that it is ready for decommissioning when its task is finished and then stops; a `standing` type reports and waits for the next item.

### Launch

For a new interactive session only, ask whether to launch.

Keep the existing Tasks item and name cells byte-for-byte: approval changes ownership and state, not the task's wording. The launcher reads the assignment back from the item, so do not rewrite it to clarify scope during launch. Pass the row's `name` cell as `--task`; it resolves to the one row with that name. Pass the item exactly as the row spells it only when the row has no name or shares its name with another row, which the launcher refuses.

Launching a session of a named type is two calls in one message, and neither is improvised:

```
chief-of-stuff worktree --type <type> --name <tree> --branch <branch> --root . --clone <repo>
chief-of-stuff worker --type <type> --cwd <the path the first printed> --name <the session's name> --root . --task <the Tasks name> --coordinator <your own name, as a listing spells it>
```

Before proposing a new task for dispatch, validate its Tasks and File ownership rows with `chief-of-stuff worker --check --root . --task <name>`, which needs no `--cwd`, makes no worktree and starts nothing; add `--name <session>` when the task is a standing row and `--one-shot` for a one-shot task; when it prints `refused: <why>`, tell the user that refusal and do not propose the task.

`<repo>` is the repository's checkout directory; when the settings' `[repos]` table names that repository, pass the name instead. When the block names no `Agent:` lines, use `--type implementer` on the worktree call (its required role label) and omit `--type` on the worker call; the worker then runs the default agent and its skills. An agy session adds `--runtime agy --model <the id from agy models>` to the second call; it has no agent types, so `--type` does nothing there. A Claude session passes its explicitly chosen `--model <id>` and optional `--effort <high|medium|low>`; neither is derived from the session name. A standing session's placeholder row (`<name>: standing <role> …`, launched as that name) needs no issue.

Codex sessions add `--runtime codex` and optionally `--model <id>`; Cursor sessions add `--runtime cursor` and optionally `--model <id>`. They start with a plan gate, use the mailbox, and register their process. Their `--type` is ignored. Codex starts read-only and the user resumes the same session with write access after approving its plan.

### One-shot

If `[workers] mode = "one-shot"` in the workspace TOML, every task dispatch runs one-shot; the launcher enforces this without a flag. A task-specific request for an interactive session authorizes that task's launch with `--interactive` in a one-shot workspace. If the workspace is interactive and the user requests one-shot for a particular task, pass `--one-shot` for that launch. Do not edit the workspace TOML to satisfy a task-specific request. Choose `--runtime claude|agy|codex|cursor` as usual. One-shot runs one CLI turn in the worktree, and the launcher returns when it exits. It does not open a terminal tab, register a continuing session, poll a mailbox, or ask for plan approval inside the worker. The workspace setting authorizes routine launches without per-task approval; a task-specific one-shot request authorizes that launch. The launcher writes the tracker itself, under the lock `chief-of-stuff log` takes: when it starts, the task's owner becomes the worker's name and its state `running HH:MM`, the task's File ownership row gains `; worktree `<tree>` (<branch>)`, and a Log line names the runtime, model, tree and task. Write none of these yourself, before or during the run; it changes the row again when it returns. Launch every ready one-shot task whose File ownership paths overlap no running task at once, in the same turn, each as its own launcher call started in the background (Bash `run_in_background: true`); when two ready tasks overlap each other, launch the earlier row first and the other when it returns. Give each launch its own Bash call with `run_in_background: true`; never chain launches with `;` or `&&`, never pipe a launch, and never start one without the flag. Add no `| head`, `| tail` or `| cut` to a launch: its whole output is read from the notification's output file. A background launch's completion notification only says the launch ended: name the task in its Bash description, and on the notification read that task's report with `chief-of-stuff result --root . --task <the Tasks name>`, then reconcile it, sync the issue's Kanban state and report that task before using its result. A launcher refusal for overlap, or for the concurrency cap (`max_concurrency` under `[workers]`), is not a blocker: leave the task `open` and launch it when a running task returns. When one launch fails mid-batch the others keep running; do not retry a held or failed task without resolving its blocker. Explain that the worker may edit, commit, and open a PR according to the workspace workflow in that one run. Do not dispatch a standing placeholder this way; a launcher call starts exactly one task. The launcher writes a TOON report at `<worktree>/.chief-of-stuff/one-shot-report.toon` and prints it. On completion it sets the tracker row to `waiting` under the configured user for normal integration or review. On an unfinished run, including a failed process, timeout, or missing worker result, it also adds the configured human-review hold to the issue without changing its numbered stage and comments with the reason and partial changes. A report with `status: relaunch` means the worker stopped before changing anything because its premise moved, such as its base or target pull request merging; the launcher set the row back to `unassigned` and `open` with no hold. That is not a held or failed task and not the user's to decide: relaunch it now in a fresh worktree from current main, without asking, and log why. A second stop on the same task comes back as human review. Read and reconcile any errors in the report; a failed issue update is not a successful hold. No coordinator or worker mailbox messages are part of this mode. The default time limit is 60 minutes; `--timeout-minutes N` changes it.

### After launch

The second call writes the assignment into the tree and prints where. You do not type the assignment into that command: the script reads it back from the two rows you named, so they have to exist and to say what they need to say **before** you launch or propose. A task the tracker does not carry is refused; so is a task whose owner is not `unassigned`, a task with no File ownership row, a task with no issue (or a cell that is neither one nor `workflow`) where the block names a backlog, and a row carrying `(via ` — nothing starts, and the refusal says which.

`--name` is the session's name for its whole life: the listing, the prompt box, the tab and its assignment all carry it, and the harness never retitles a name given at launch (the user, 2026-09-22 16:18: "the NUMERIC NAMES I ASSIGN ARE THE ONLY NAMES THEY ARE ALLOWED TO KEEP"). A session started without one is named after its directory and then retitled from its first task, which is why it is never left out.

`--coordinator` is how a session learns who to register with. It has no ref of its own to report until it looks itself up, and you have no way to reach it until it does. Your own name is the one in the tracker header, or the one a listing shows beside your ref. Pass it when you have it and drop it when you do not: a name you guessed at is worse than the assignment's own wording, which already says to register with the chief-of-stuff coordinator.

Then, for an interactive session, update the File ownership row's context cell to name the tree the first call printed (a one-shot launch records it itself), never the one you asked for: a row naming a tree that was never created sat in the tracker for eight hours. If either call refuses, the task stays `open`, say what was refused, and create nothing by hand.
